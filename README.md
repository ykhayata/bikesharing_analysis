# NYC Citi Bike Analysis

## Purpose of Project

The main purpose of the project was to use data from New York City's Citi Bike program as an example and determine whether or not it would be fitting to translate this type of program in Iowa. We used Python's pandas library to clean the data and then created graphs and visualizations with the use of Tableau.

## Our Results

### How long do the customers bike for?

Our line graph shows the duration of every bike ride during 08/2019. We can conclude that riders typically like to bike anywhere between 2 and 16 minutes.

### Common Beginning and End Locations for Bikers

My two visualizations are showing the most common starting and ending locations. We can see that most rides start in rather populous areas in the middle of Manhattan, and end around these same populous areas. It is quite evident that customers are using these bikes to make their way around Manhattan for the most part.

### Checkout Times by Gender?

We can conclude that most riders that check-out bikes are Male.

### User Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

We see that the peak ride hours for males and females are virtually the same, as Monday to Friday from 6AM-9AM and 5PM-7PM are the most common. We can conclude that many customers ride the bikes to and from work.

## Our Conclusion

How are we going to create a successful citi bikesharing program in Iowa.

1: We will place bikes in the most populous areas in Des Moines, preferably in the downtown area.

2: We will target Males for the most part as the main user demographic in all marketing/advertising initiatives.

3: We will offer discounts and promotions during non-commuter hours to maxmize sales throughout ALL hours of the day.
